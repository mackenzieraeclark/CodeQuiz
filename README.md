# CodeQuiz
This application is a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

As an actively interviewing full-stack applicant, it is important to be familiar with common code tests. This program will test the user's knowledge on basic javascript principles using the following guidelines:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

The user will be able to see the time elapse, go through all of the questions, and be able to access their score even after the browser is closed.
